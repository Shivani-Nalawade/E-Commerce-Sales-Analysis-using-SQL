# E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-using-SQL

This project demonstrates how to analyze an E-Commerce dataset using SQL to extract insights about customer behavior, sales trends, and profitability. The dataset consists of two tables: Customer_Details and Order_Details. The queries explore key business metrics like sales growth, customer lifetime value, and product performance.

## Features
- Sales analysis by region, product category, and customer segment.
- Profitability and ROI calculations.
- Seasonality and sales growth trends.
  
## Techniques and Components Used in Queries

## 1. Joins

Joins are used to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns.

Inner Join: Ensures only matching rows from both tables are included.
  
## 2. Aggregate Functions

Functions like SUM(), COUNT(), and AVG() are used to perform calculations on grouped data.

SUM(): To calculate total sales or quantities.

COUNT(): To count the number of orders, customers, etc.

AVG(): To find average sales or profit margins.

## 3. Grouping

GROUP BY is used to organize data into groups for aggregate analysis.

## 4. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs are used to simplify complex queries by breaking them into readable parts.

## 5. Window Functions

Window functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and OVER() provide advanced analytics without grouping the data.

## 6. Filtering

WHERE Clause: To filter data based on conditions.

HAVING Clause: To filter grouped data based on aggregate functions.

## 7. Date Functions

Date functions are used to extract or manipulate date values.

## 8. Derived Columns

Creating new columns by performing calculations directly in the SELECT statement.
